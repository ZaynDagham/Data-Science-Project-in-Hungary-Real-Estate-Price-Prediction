# Data Science Project in Hungary: Real Estate Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict real estate prices in Hungary using data science techniques. The primary focus is on three cities: Gyor, Budapest, and Pecs. While the code and analysis provided are specific to the city of Gyor, the same process can be applied to the other cities with different datasets.

## Project Structure
- **Notebooks**: Contains Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.
- **Models**: Stores trained machine learning models or model artifacts.
- **Visualizations**: Contains any visualizations generated during EDA or model evaluation.

## Data Sources
- Web scraping techniques were employed to gather additional data from relevant real estate website. from [ingatlan.jofogas.hu].

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing and visualizing the data to gain insights.
- **Model Development**: Building and training machine learning models for price prediction.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Summary of the Project
- The project involves predicting real estate prices in Hungary, focusing on three cities: Gyor, Budapest, and Pecs.
- Data from various sources, including web scraping, is collected and preprocessed.
- Exploratory data analysis is performed to understand the dataset better and extract valuable insights.
- Machine learning models are trained and evaluated for predicting real estate prices.

## Results
- The project achieved promising results in predicting real estate prices.
- The R2 scores & Models for each city are as follows:
  - Gyor: [0.73] - Random Forest Regressor
  - Budapest: [0.61] - Gradient Boosting Regressor
  - Pecs: [0.67] - LightGBM
